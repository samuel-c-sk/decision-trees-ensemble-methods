## English summary of the analysis

This project investigates the performance of decision trees and ensemble learning methods in both regression and classification tasks.  
The analysis compares single decision trees (with and without pruning) to ensemble approaches, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and BART.

For the classification task, ensemble methods significantly outperform a single decision tree, achieving higher accuracy and substantially better ROC–AUC values.  
Random Forest in particular demonstrates improved robustness and generalization compared to an individual tree model.

In the regression setting, pruning does not lead to performance improvements for single trees.  
Ensemble methods, especially boosting-based approaches and BART, achieve lower prediction error and better overall model fit, highlighting their ability to capture complex nonlinear relationships.

Overall, the results confirm that while decision trees offer interpretability, ensemble methods provide superior predictive performance in both regression and classification problems.
